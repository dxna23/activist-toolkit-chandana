        Not everyone has the same opportunities, especially in education.
      </h2>

      <p>
        Access to education should be equal for all people, regardless of their
        age, gender, or race. In many developing countries, there is a harsh
        reality for girls especially who are considered to be future homemakers
        rather than worthy to go to school. Our cause is to increase awareness
        of the importance of educating females in developing countries.

        Poverty
      </h2>
      <p>
        The reasons girls in many developing countries are not getting the
        education they deserve are endless. One of the most significant reasons
        for girls, especially in Latin American countries, not getting educated
        how they should be is due to the extreme poverty levels faced by said
        countries; many families cannot provide and/or afford to send their
        daughters to school everyday and instead, keep them at home to help with
        chores or earning money.

      <h2>
        Child Marriage
      </h2>
      <p>
        A significant reason why many girls, especially in India, are not being
        sent to school or being pulled out early is due to child marriage. In
        many South Asian countries, it is a common practice to marry off
        daughters at a very young ages, usually as soon as the girl has her
        first menstrual cycle, signaling that the girl is mature enough for
        marriage. As soon as girls in India get married, they are expected to
        provide food for their husbands and keep up with housework; this leads
        to a large, illiterate female population due to the lack of schooling.

        Take A Stand
      </h2>
      <p>
        Girls in developing countries that are unable or restricted from being
        able to get an equal opportunity to education/schools. These girls are
        not being provided with the education they deserve and are considered a
        human right because of situational conflicts and possible lack of
        resources. In America, access to education is a human right and we don’t
        see why it can’t be that same in other countries despite the
        socioeconomic state. All girls deserve a chance to learn and educate
        themselves to fulfil their dreams. We want to reach students, parents,
        teachers, and as many people around the world, specifically developed
        countries like America, in which the access to education is considered a
        human right. We want to appeal to educated women in developed countries
        who have achieved their goals due to their access to educational
        resources; if we have enough traction, there is likely to be lasting
        change in these developing countries.
