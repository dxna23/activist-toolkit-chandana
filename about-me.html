          Hi! My name is Chandana Akasapu and I am a rising junior in high
          school. I was motivated to creating a site about education inequities
          for girls in developing countries because I know a lot of girls in my
          parents’ home in South Asia, specifically India. These girls are
          exceedingly smart but their families don’t have the money to send
          them, or choose to marry them off at a young age, and there are a
          multitude of other situational reasons why these girls don’t get the
          education they deserve. In America, access to education is a human
          right and I believe that should be the standard everywhere, regardless
          of the GDP. I wouldn’t be able to achieve goals and strive for
          perfection in my life if it weren’t for the human rights of education
          given to me as an American citizen.

          Hello! My name is Shreeya Prabu and I’m an eleventh grader from
          Irving, TX. I think that education should be a universal right and
          that everyone should be able to advance in society with the tool of
          knowledge. In many developing countries, females are not given the
          same educational opportunities as males and are instead left to work
          at the household, bearing children, cooking and cleaning. This
          continues the cycle of poverty and disables girls to be independent
          and self-sufficient. I think that raising awareness for this cause and
          funding their education will definitely help many girls and make our
          world a better place!

      We are very determined to make things better for girls living in bad educational situations in developing countries in South Asia, Latin America, and Africa. We chose to work together to create something that is bound to lead to reform.
