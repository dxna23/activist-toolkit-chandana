        <p class="what-do">
          Please support women and girls in developing countries by supporting
          the Women's Educational Equity Act of 1974 and volunteering/donating
          to organizations that support the education of women all over the
          world, especially in places in which girls are less likely to have
          access to education resources. In addition, support the movement to
          amend the Women's Educational Equity Act of 1974 and extend its reach
          to the furthest developing regions and countries. If enough people
          support these organizations and movements, there’s both a very real
          chance at increased governmental influence and support for women’s
          education being on the same footing as men’s education as well as a
          vast increase in the amount of women/girls receiving educational aid
          from these organizations.
